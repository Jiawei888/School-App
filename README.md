# School-App
This mobile app aims to provide a platform to facilitate easy and convenient communication between a school, its students and their parents. You are required to build an Android application that provides an interactive environment, allowing school admins to provide updates regarding different events or activities to both the students and their parents. This School App consists of Student, Parent and Admin sections. The Student section consists of signup, login, viewing profile, notice board, and events. The Parent section includes signup, login, viewing student profile, events and any communication from the school. You have to note that a parent can have more than one child in the school. The school Admin can manage the students details (add, delete, update), create/update notifications, create/update events and send communications to parents. The notifications, events and other communications (such as sending a letter to parents) can be sent to individuals, a class or the whole school cohort.
